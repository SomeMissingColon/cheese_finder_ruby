My macron_email_data_analysis repo was kind of a big name for my coding level at the time.
It got a little better since then.

Cheese finder is a program that parses the leaked emails of Emmanuel Macron and finds the word 'fromage' inside of them.
When it finally finds a cheese (first appearence at email #218), it will add the email link where it found it, aswell as the index at which it is found.
